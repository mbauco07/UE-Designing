# UE-Designing
A Repo where I will put current in progress and finished items from time spent in Unreal Engine 5. This will inlcude maps, from inception to actual modelling and more.

First game: 2d Side Scroller:
  Goal is to create a very basic 2d side scorller platformer, that will allow me to learn more about the Unreal Engine blueprints system as well very basic level design.
  The initial starting point (this includes the pawn sprites and basic platforms is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTsDv2jdTsg&t=1176s). I do not intend to make in-depth 
  level art and instead focus more on creating blueprints and levels.
  
  The main goal of the game is to get from the starting point of a given level and reach the end goal. If you hit any spikes/out of bounds area you will reset the current level.
  The characther can only jump once however:
    There are green spheres which when the chracther goes over gives the characther a very brief time window where they are given a second jump.
