# UE-Designing
A Repo where I will put current in progress and finished items from time spent in Unreal Engine 5. This will inlcude maps, from inception to actual modelling and more.

First game: 2d Side Scroller:
  Goal is to create a very basic 2d side scorller platformer, that will allow me to learn more about the Unreal Engine blueprints system as well very basic level design.
  The initial starting point (this includes the pawn sprites and basic platforms is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTsDv2jdTsg&t=1176s). I do not intend to make in-depth 
  level art and instead focus more on creating blueprints and levels.
  
  The main goal of the game is to get from the starting point of a given level and reach the end goal. If you hit any spikes/out of bounds area you will reset the current level.
  The characther can only jump once however:
    There are green spheres which when the chracther goes over gives the characther a very brief time window where they are given a second jump. 
  The orange speheres forcefully push the characther towards the right of the screen.

# Level/Map Design
 Main goal is to simply create some basic levels/maps with a basic intention or design feature in mind.
 Map 1: Symmetric "Speedball" Map:
  This map is meant to be a fast paced and high action map which could of been found in shooting games. The entire map is flipped from one side to another with certain objects within the map being also interactable.

  Red squares are meant to be explosive barrels with can be destroyed after enough damaged is sustained.
  Yellow is cover which can be used by players.
  Blue is cover which can be destroyed once enough damage is sustained.
